# 🚀 Multi-PDF Chatbot Powered by Google Gemini, Pinecone, and LangChain!

Excited to share my latest project: an AI-powered chatbot that enables seamless interaction with multiple PDFs using the modern **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture.

## 🔧 How It’s Built:
- 📘 Harnessed Google Gemini AI models for embeddings & conversational abilities (`gemini-embedding-001` and `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- 🗂️ Utilized Pinecone as the vector database for efficient semantic search across PDF contents
- 🛠️ Employed LangChain for orchestration—handling document splitting, workflow management, and modular pipeline
- 📄 Incorporated PyPDF2 for parsing and extracting data from any number of PDFs
- 🔄 Added a query rewriting system for smarter, context-aware follow-up questions
- 🧠 Designed thread-aware conversational memory to keep interactions coherent and relevant

## 🔬 RAG Architecture in Action:
Combining vector search with generative AI, the chatbot first retrieves the most relevant document chunks and then formulates responses using the context—ensuring answers are grounded in your PDFs.

## ✨ What Makes This Unique:
- 🔹 The approach is tailored with Google’s GenAI stack and Pinecone for reliable, scalable semantic search
- 🔸 Query rewriting enables full context for every interaction, no matter the conversation depth
- 🔹 Managed through environment variables for security and easy deployment

## 📝 Workflow Overview:
PDF(s) → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embeddings → Pinecone Storage/Retrieval → Query Rewriting → Gemini-powered Answers

## 🤖 Use Cases:
Perfect for reading technical docs, contracts, or stories: upload PDFs, ask your questions, and get context-sensitive, honest answers. If the bot can’t find context, it responds transparently (“I don’t know”).

Excited by the possibilities of RAG and next-gen NLP! Would love to connect or chat about document Q&A, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or vector search.
